The colour palette was created using the to generate some colour codes as inspiration for the site.
The colours are cheerful tones that match the image that brings the feeling of a party, celebration, and a fresh start.

### Typography
Google Fonts was used for the following font:

Roboto is used for the page. It's a modern and smooth font that brings clarity to the text.

### Imagery
The photos featured throughout the site were obtained from free image providers such as Pexels. I chose the bg-image for the background because it is an image that has party confetti, it refers to celebrations and that is why it is associated with the new year celebration. 

### Site Structure
Resolution's List is 1 pages website, where the user can easily interact creating a list of wishes for the next year.

### Wireframes
The Wireframes were produced using Balsamiq. The final site varies from the wireframes due to developments that occurred during the building process.
